**_What are we going to make?_**

The Group 10’s Magess delivery service provides its users with a clever and “beginners-friendly” software which can complete various types of everyday tasks for them.

Whatever you need to pick up, whether it’s groceries, parcels or medicine, it can be done through the Magess delivery system.

The service features a Smartcar and an android application, in which users can track when and where their parcel will be delivered.

The device can be used in multiple ways, such as buying daily goods from the nearest grocery store or pick up and send packages from the post office.
