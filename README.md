**_What are we going to make?_**

The Group 10’s Magess delivery service provides its users with a clever and “beginners-friendly” software which can complete various types of everyday tasks for them.

Whatever you need to pick up, whether it’s groceries, parcels or medicine, it can be done through the Magess delivery system.

The service features a Smartcar and an android application, in which users can track when and where their parcel will be delivered.

The device can be used in multiple ways, such as buying daily goods from the nearest grocery store or pick up and send packages from the post office. 

**_How can this device help us?_**

Due to the spread of the coronavirus (covid-19), people are recommended to stay at home and avoid physical contact. It is specifically made for people with a compromised immune system, elders or disabled, where going out could put them at high risk for contracting the virus.

**_How are we going to make it?_**

With the combination of an android application and a Smartcar device, users will be able to send and receive parcels through the Magess delivery service.
