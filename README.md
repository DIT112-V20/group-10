**_What have we made?_**

The Magess Delivery car is a Smartcar that can help you send things between friends and family, it is simple to use and perfect for you who are too lazy to do it yourself, or now during the covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic avoiding personal contact as much as possible! 

Whatever you need to pick up, whether itâ€™s groceries, parcels or medicine, it can be done through the Magess delivery system.

The service features a Smartcar and an Android application, in which users can track where their parcel will be delivered.

At the moment, the product works best for personal use. We want to expand the use cases but due to time constraints and being restricted by the current pandemic it was not feasible, for now.

When the code is uploaded to the car you can now turn on the app and it will automatically connect to the car as long as it is powered on!

When starting the app you will come to this screen:
